    "The final conclusion is that the model has generally performed well in assigning languages (in cases where I can personally distinguish English, Polish, German, and Spanish). However, the analysis has also shown that the model incorrectly assigns labels to certain texts, such as offensive language. One of the reasons for this behavior could be the absence of such texts in the training corpus. If this were true, it would violate one of the basic principles of NLP, which states that the corpus should be as representative as possible for a given language. This is a significant drawback of this model, as offensive texts are often present in social media. Another drawback of the model is the limited number of languages it supports (only 20). Therefore, when working with less common languages, the model would be of no use. On the positive side, the model exhibits high accuracy in general texts, as demonstrated by the results from the publication. In this case, what could help? As shown in example number 1, a higher degree of data cleaning could lead to better model results. However, this cleaning cannot go too far because LLMs are trained on natural language, so, for example, removing stop words would be too much interference. Therefore, a more careful and selective text cleaning to a limited extent would be useful. Of course, as I mentioned earlier, it also depends a lot on the data on which the model was trained, whether it saw "strange punctuation constructions," errors, or only clean expressions in a given language."
